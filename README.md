Contribution Guides
--------------------------------------

In the spirit of open source software development, jQuery always encourages community code contribution. To help you get started and before you jump into writing code, be sure to read these important contribution guidelines thoroughly:

1. [Getting Involved](https://contribute.jquery.org/)
2. [Core Style Guide](https://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/)
3. [Writing Code for jQuery Foundation Projects](https://contribute.jquery.org/code/)


Environments in which to use jQuery
--------------------------------------

- [Browser support](https://jquery.com/browser-support/)
- jQuery also supports Node, browser extensions, and other non-browser environments.


What you need to build your own jQuery
--------------------------------------

To build jQuery, you need to have the latest Node.js/npm and git 1.7 or later. Earlier versions might work, but are not supported.

For Windows, you have to download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

macOS users should install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Once Homebrew is installed, run `brew install git` to install git,
and `brew install node` to install Node.js.

Linux/BSD users should use their appropriate package managers to install git and Node.js, or build from source
